To add a new song:

* Frisk_variables should contain the new song "variables". Beware
  TT_GLOBAL_SPEED must be equal to 1. The code to handle the other
  case has been removed. 4 variables have to be moved from the
  `_trackdata` file (TT_FREQ_MASK, TT_INS_HOLD, TT_INS_PAUSE and
  TT_FIRST_PERC). Eventually, the file extension must be changed from
  .asm to .inc.

* Frisk_init must be copied/renamed too. Initial _tt_cur_pat_index_*
  have to be updated according to the new song.

* Frisk_player must be copied/renamed to the new song's
  repository. The frisk_ prefix has to be updated to point to the new
  song labels.

* Frisk_trackdata contains the actual song. It must be the new song's
  trackdata file translated to ca65.
  - The echo at the end of the file  has to be removed.
  - Block `IF THUND_TT_GLOBAL_SPEED = 0` has to be removed.

* A couple of files have to be updated:
  - bank0/c/main.c
  - include/song_player.h
  - asminc/song_player.inc

TODO: trackdata conversion tool to be written.
